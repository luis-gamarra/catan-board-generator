# Catan Board Generator

The project generates a Catan game board given the following assumptions:

- There are a total of 19 terrain hexes
- The first and last rows contain three terrain hexes
- The second and second to last rows contain four terrain hexes

The game board is represented by a 2-D array of strings. `X` represent boundaries. `d` represents the desert terrain hex.

 
Sample output:
```
pasture fields mountain 
forest hills pasture fields 
mountain pasture desert mountain forest 
hills fields hills fields 
forest pasture forest
```
